#Food Vision
Project Overview
Food Vision is a deep learning project that leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify food images into various categories. The goal of this project was to surpass the accuracy benchmark set by a research paper that used traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods. By implementing CNNs, specifically EfficientNetB0 through transfer learning, I achieved a significant improvement in accuracy over the traditional ML approaches.

Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project was to explore the potential of CNNs in food image classification and to challenge the results obtained in a published research paper. Traditional Machine Learning techniques, while effective, often fall short in tasks involving complex visual data. By employing deep learning and CNNs, I aimed to push the boundaries and achieve better performance in food image recognition.

Model and Dataset
For this project, I utilized the EfficientNetB0 architecture, a state-of-the-art CNN known for its efficiency and accuracy. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset comprising 101 food categories, each containing 750 images, totaling 75,750 images.

The dataset was sourced from the Food-101 dataset, a popular benchmark for food classification tasks. The images in this dataset vary significantly in terms of lighting, angle, and presentation, making it a challenging yet ideal dataset for this project.

Results
By leveraging CNNs, specifically EfficientNetB0, I achieved an impressive 90% accuracy on the test set, significantly outperforming the traditional ML methods mentioned in the research paper. This demonstrates the superiority of deep learning models in handling complex visual classification tasks.

Conclusion
Food Vision serves as a testament to the power of Convolutional Neural Networks in image classification tasks. Through this project, I not only surpassed the accuracy benchmarks set by traditional ML methods but also gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of transfer learning and CNN architectures like EfficientNetB0. This project highlights the potential of deep learning in achieving state-of-the-art results in challenging domains like food image classification.
